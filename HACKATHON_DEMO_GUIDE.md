# Dataxplaining Hackathon Demo Script (3 Minutes)

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to record a high-impact demo of **Dataxplaining**. The demo focuses on the "Scholarly Compendium" aesthetic and the advanced Gemini API integrations.

---

## **Minute 0:00 - 0:30: The Hook & The Library**
**Goal:** Establish the aesthetic and the "Manuscript" concept.

1.  **Start at the Home Screen.**
    *   *Action:* Scroll slowly through the lesson grid. 
    *   *Narrative:* "Welcome to Dataxplaining. We’ve reimagined machine learning education not as a series of videos, but as a tactile, scholarly compendium. Inspired by Hacksplaining, we move beyond code to provide visual intuition for 15+ mathematical models."
2.  **Highlight the Filtering.**
    *   *Action:* Click the "Supervised Learning" category filter, then "Beginner" difficulty.
    *   *Narrative:* "Our library ranges from foundational regression to advanced reinforcement learning, all wrapped in a modern editorial aesthetic."

---

## **Minute 0:30 - 1:00: Personalization (The Identity Synthesis)**
**Goal:** Show how the Gemini API tailors the experience to the user.

3.  **Open Personalization.**
    *   *Action:* Click **"Personalize"** in the top nav.
    *   *Action:* Enter: **Role:** "Policy Advisor", **Industry:** "Urban Planning", **Goal:** "Understand social impact of AI."
    *   *Action:* Click **"Sync Profile."**
    *   *Narrative:* "Data isn't neutral, and neither is learning. By defining our identity, we allow Gemini to synthesize a curriculum tailored specifically to our industry and constraints."

## **Minute 1:00 - 2:00: Interactive Simulation & Deep Reasoning**
**Goal:** Show the "Tactile Simulation", "Neural Insight", and "Consult References" feature.

4.  **Enter a Manuscript.**
    *   *Action:* Click on the **"K-Nearest Neighbors"** card.
    *   *Action:* Advance to Step 2 (The Majority Vote).
5.  **Tactile Interaction.**
    *   *Action:* Click on various parts of the grid to classify new points.
    *   *Action:* Drag the **"K" (Neighborhood Scope)** slider.
    *   *Narrative:* "Here, we explore K-Nearest Neighbors. By clicking the feature space, we see classification in real-time. As we adjust 'K', the decision boundaries shift dynamically."
6.  **Show Neural Insight.**
    *   *Action:* Point the cursor at the **"Neural Insight"** text in the bottom right of the simulation box.
    *   *Narrative:* "Note the 'Neural Insight'—Gemini 3 Flash is constantly monitoring our parameters, providing a micro-analysis of our classification confidence as we move."
7.  **Consult Deep Reasoning (Gemini 3 Pro).**
    *   *Action:* Click **"Consult Deep Reasoning References"** in the sidebar.
    *   *Action:* Wait for the explanation to appear. Click one of the **"Suggested Calibrations"** (e.g., "Set K to 1").
    *   *Narrative:* "If the logic feels abstract, we consult our Deep Reasoning engine. Powered by Gemini 3 Pro, it analyzes our current neighborhood scope to provide expert-level analogies and direct calibration suggestions."

## **Minute 2:00 - 2:35: Voice Laboratory (Real-Time AI)**
**Goal:** Demonstrate low-latency multimodal interaction using CNN Filters.

8.  **Switch to CNN Filters.**
    *   *Action:* Click "Library Home" then select **"CNN Filters"**.
9.  **Activate Voice Lab.**
    *   *Action:* Click **"Voice Laboratory"** in the left sidebar.
    *   *Action:* (Wait for the blue waveform). Ask: *"How does the Edge Detection filter help a car see pedestrians?"*
    *   *Narrative:* "For a truly immersive experience, we engage the Voice Laboratory. Using Gemini's Native Audio capabilities, we can discuss the spatial logic of CNN Filters in real-time while observing the convolutional scan."

---

## **Minute 2:35 - 3:00: The Prophecy & Conclusion**
**Goal:** Show the multimodal "Image Generation" and customized closing.

10. **The Prophetic Vision.**
    *   *Action:* Scroll down in the sidebar and click **"Visualize Real-World Application."**
    *   *Action:* Click the generated image to open the full-screen modal.
    *   *Narrative:* "Finally, we look toward the future. Gemini generates a tailored 'Prophecy'—a Roman-aesthetic visualization and a written scenario of how these image filters apply to our specific role in Urban Planning."
11. **Closing Shot.**
    *   *Action:* Close the modal and show the Library Home one last time.
    *   *Narrative:* "Dataxplaining: Making the invisible logic of AI visible, tactile, and human. Thank you."

## **Pro-Tips for Recording:**
*   **Audio Cues:** Ensure your system audio is recorded so the minimalist chimes, blips, and clicks are heard.
*   **Resolution:** Record at 1080p or 4K to make the "JetBrains Mono" telemetry text sharp and readable.
*   **Cursor:** Use a high-visibility cursor so judges can follow your clicks on the sliders and the grid.
